I like planes but I don't like heights, isn't that funny? Continuing the previous sentence, I also like the view of the water from boats of smallish sizes; but I don't like actually being on boats due to their tendency to sink. I am in a watersport, wherein I am constantly rowing on the surface of a deep body of water in a small vessel. The view is terrific, and the air is clear, but those things become trivial when the constant threat of possibly winding up below the surface of the water. It does truly make it hard to have a grand old time.
